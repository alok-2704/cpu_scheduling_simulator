# TODO: Fix PID Squeeze and Adjust Theme Button for Mobile

- [x] Update static/css/style.css to make #themeToggle smaller in mobile view while keeping it at bottom right
- [x] Update static/js/app.js to use smaller font and box for PID text on narrow Gantt bars
- [x] Test the changes on mobile view to ensure PID fits and button is smaller
